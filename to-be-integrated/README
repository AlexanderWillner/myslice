This area is for pieces that need a bit more tuning before being plugged into the framework

** pres_view

. the whole naming presview / presviewview kind of sucks overall - an understatement
. please at least rename the plugin into something that does not have 'view' in it
. also please review the static contents to re-use what we already have as third-party, 
  or to add in there what is still missing

** code editor / codemirror

. I could not find where this is used
. the most painful impact of this is that it depends on codemirror, that comes with a huge amount
  of static files
. this is why I move it away for now
