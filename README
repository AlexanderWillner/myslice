This file documents the contents of this module

See devel/ for more devel-oriented doc.

==================== 1st level subdirs
* myslice: 
  this is the sjango project', where to look for
  . settings
  . urls
  . common static files 

* insert_above: 
  a third-party django app for adding on-the-fly mentions to css or js files that need to go in the header
  much like our past drupal_set_html_head() 

* auth: 
  a django 'app' that deals with authentication

* slice:
  a django app for dealing with slice views

* templates/
* static/
  initially I had started to keep:
   * templates (html templates with embedded python-like django chunks) 
   * static files (css, js, images..)
  locally in the app were they belong
  but I ended up with having the need to move up and down the tree endlessly
  so for the beginning at least, I have moved everything in a unique place
  this convention is subject to change

---
* devel:
  no code in there, only various notes and other scripts useful for developers

* all-static: (generated, no need to source-control)
  this is where 'manage.py collectstatic' will gather all your static contents if you run a local server
  make has convenience targets to refresh this area
  $ make clean-static 
  $ make static 

==================== initial conventions for templates and static

* templates:
  we store this under templates/ within the corresponding app, e.g.
  auth/templates/login.html
  for now this is only about html, but the engine can be used for rendering anything including json or whatever..

* static files:
  we chose to have all static files (images, but also javascript and stylesheets) in the various
  proj or app where they belong, under a static/ subdir that has this structure:
  where-it-belongs/
    static/
      img/
      css/
      js/
  the stuff I have so far is in myslice/ because it looks common to all apps..
