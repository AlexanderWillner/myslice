not quite sure where to store the wsgi application file in the codebase
it used to be in unfold/wsgi.py but that looked a bit awkward
one of the reasons for that is, the apache/ config (apache/unfold.conf)
needs to reference the installed wsgi file, so we'd rather not have this
installed in the python library where names are not known in advance

So at some point it was decided to have it moved with the apache/ config
The symlink here is only for the django development server to find it at run time
see settings.py and the definition of WSGI_APPLICATION
