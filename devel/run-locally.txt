In order to run this module in standalone mode

 * install python and django for your OS (see devel/django-install.txt)

 * make syncdb
 that won't hurt

 * make collectstatic
 although this is not really needed anymore now that we have a single
 location for tempaltes and static, but if any static file gets added
 in some other place, this will be important

 * manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080
 for a one-shot run of the local server

 * if you need to often restart the server, you can use 
 devel/server-loop.sh
 that runs 'manage runserver ...' in an endless loop, just hit ctrl-C
 to kill the current server instance and run another one
 

 * as a final note, it is explained here
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/#createsuperuser
how it seems easily possible to have 'make syncdb', or at least the
part that prompts for login/password, run non-interactively
for example as part of the packaging install

manage.py createsuperuser --username root --email support@myslice.info --noinput

-- or --

django-admin.py createsuperuser --username root --email support@myslice.info  --noinput
except that on my MAC for now I haven't been able to find the port command to select this
version, to for me it's still django-admin-2.7.py

a caveat though is, this cannot be run several times (it fails the second time, duplicate column of course)
it's still doable to redirect >& /dev/null and not worry about the result I guess
I'm not even sure it's really useful ?!?
