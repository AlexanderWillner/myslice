In order to run this module in standalone mode

 * install python and django for your OS (see devel/django-install.txt)

 * make syncdb
 that won't hurt

 * make collectstatic
 although this is not really needed anymore now that we have a single
 location for tempaltes and static, but if any static file gets added
 in some other place, this will be important

 * manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080
 for a one-shot run of the local server

 * if you need to often restart the server, you can use 
 devel/server-loop.sh
 that runs 'manage runserver ...' in an endless loop, just hit ctrl-C
 to kill the current server instance and run another one
