Dear OneLab user,

You have recently requested a slice in the OneLab portal.

Slice name      : {{slice_name}}
URL             : {{number_of_nodes}}
Purpose         : {{purpose}}

We are glad to inform you that, a manager of your institution has validated your slice request. You can now add resources to the slice and start experimenting.

On behalf of the entire team, I wish you a fruitful user experience on OneLab.

Yours sincerely,

Timur Friedman
Executive Director
