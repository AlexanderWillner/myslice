Dear {{first_name}} {{last_name}},

It is our pleasure to welcome you as a fully signed-up user of the SmartFIRE experimental facility. SmartFIRE provides you with access to world class computer networking testbeds.. Our aim at SmartFIRE is to promote the use of these testbeds for pre-commercial research and development by industry, for scientific research, and for university level laboratory exercises.

Your entry point for access to the testbeds is the SmartFIRE portal, which provides a web-based interface for browsing and reserving resources on the various testbeds. To run an experiment using those resources, you may log in to the testbed and/or to individual nodes on the testbed with your SmartFIRE public/private key pair, or you may use an experiment control tool such as as  OMF. The SmartFIRE operations team is standing by at support@onelab.eu to provide you with help regarding the portal and to refer your testbed- and tool-specific queries to those best able to answer them.

We wish you a fruitful user experience with the SmartFIRE portal.

Yours sincerely,
The SmartFIRE team
