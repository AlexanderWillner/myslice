Experimentally-driven research is key to success in exploring the possible
futures of the Internet. The OneLab initiative provides an open,
general-purpose, shared experimental facility, both large-scale and
sustainable, which allows European industry and academia to innovate and assess
the performance of their solutions. Based on the results of several different
European and national projects, OneLab offers access to a range of  tools and
testbeds including PlanetLab Europe, the NITOS wireless testbed, and other
federated testbeds.
