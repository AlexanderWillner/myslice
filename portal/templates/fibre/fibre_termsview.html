    Fibre: Future Internet testbeds experimentation between Brazil and Europe
    <br/>
</p>
<h2 align="left">Context</h2>
					<p align="left">
                    The main goal of the FIBRE project is the design, implementation and validation of a shared Future Internet research facility, supporting the joint experimentation of European and Brazilian researchers. In order to achieve this goal the project will carry out four main activities:
                    </p>
					<p align="left">
                    The development and operation of a new experimental facility in Brazil, including the setup of equipment to support experimentation with various technologies (fixed layer 2 and layer 3, wireless, optical) as well as the design and implementation of a control framework to automate the use and operation of the testbed.
                    </p>
					<p align="left">
                    The development and operation of a Future Internet facility in Europe based on enhancements and the federation of two existing infrastructures: OFELIA and OneLab. Two OFELIA islands (i2CAT and University of Bristol (UNIVBRIS)) and the UTH's NITOS testbed will be enhanced by i) adding more physical resources (servers, OpenFlow-enabled switches and access points) to be able to cope with a bigger number ofusers and different use cases, ii) improving its respective control frameworks (based on the OFELIA control framework and OMF) and iii) adding more manpower to operate the facilities.
                    </p>
					<p align="left">
                    The federation of the Brazilian and European experimental facilities, both at the physical connectivity and control framework level, to support the provisioning of slices using resources from both testbeds.
                    </p>
<h2>PROCEDURE OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>If your institution is willing to join the FIBRE Consortium, you are kindly requested to follow the steps below:<br></p>
<p>1. <a mce_href="http://www.fibre-ict.eu/images/stories/docs/fibre_mou_v0.3.doc" href="http://www.fibre-ict.eu/images/stories/docs/fibre_mou_v0.3.doc">Download the MoU model</a>  to understand the framework of collaboration between your institution and FIBRE project. The content of the MoU shall be discussed in case-by-case basis between the two parties.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;" mce_style="line-height: 1.3em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>2. Contact the Project office at <a href="mailto:info@fibre.org.br">info@fibre.org.br</a> to schedule a call to clarify all your questions concerning the duties, responsibilities and advantages of joining the FIBRE project.</p>
<p>3. If your institution understand and agree on the commitment stated in the MoU, please submit the application by editing the <a href="http://www.fibre-ict.eu/images/fibre_mou_v0.2_ff.doc" mce_href="http://www.fibre-ict.eu/images/fibre_mou_v0.2_ff.doc" style="style" mce_style="style">MoU template</a> and sending it to 
 <a href="mailto:info@fibre.org.br">info@fibre.org.br</a></p>
<p>4. Application Approval: the FIBRE General Assembly will decide based on the application and information gathered during the call. The approval process will normally take around one month.</p><p>5. By mutual agreement of both parties, MoU will be prepared and signed.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.3em;" mce_style="line-height: 1.3em;">6. Testbed usage / island installation: FIBRE will provide instructions and support to help your institution to carry out the activities described in the MoU.</span></p>
