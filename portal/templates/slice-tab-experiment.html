	<h2>How to access your slice</h2>
	<h3>PlanetLab Europe</h3>
	
	<p>
		PlanetLab Europe resources are accessible directly via SSH. Your SSH public key is deployed automatically
		on the reserved nodes. To access your slice on a resource just type the following command:
	</p>
	<p class="command">
		$ ssh converted_slice_name@planetlab-resource.hostname.com
	</p>
	<p>You need to convert your typical slicename into a specific format in order to do SSH. An example below will demonstrate the conversion:</p>
	<p class="command">
		Typical slice_name = onelab.upmc.mytestslice<br>
		converted_slice_name = onelab8upmc_mytestslice
	</p>
	<p>Please note that the first '.' is replaced by number 8 and the rest of the dot/s are replaced by underscore/s.</p>
	<p>
		Be aware that after you reserve a PlanetLab Europe resource your slice will be deployed with a delay of about 15 minutes, 
		after witch you will be able to access the resource.
	</p>
	
	<h3>FIT IoT-Lab</h3>
	<p>FIT IoT-Lab resources are accessible directly via SSH and <a href="https://devgrenoble.senslab.info/testbed/" target="_blank">web GUI.</a>
		To acess IoT-Lab resources using web GUI, use the same login and  password of OneLab portal. To acess Iot-Lab resources using SSH type
		the following command:
	</p>
	<p class="command">
		ssh onelab_username@fit3-dev.inrialpes.fr
	</p>
	
	<h3>NITOS</h3>
	
	<p>
	 NITOS resources are not directly accessible. You will need to log in on a gateway server and from there access the node.
	 The NITOS server address is nitlab.inf.uth.gr, so to connect to the NITOS server:
	</p>
	<p class="command">
	$ ssh your_slice_name@nitlab.inf.uth.gr
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<!-- In order to connect to NITOS server he has to upload his public key on the server. 
	For now we do it this way: http://nitlab.inf.uth.gr/NITlab/index.php/your-ssh-keys. 
	I think this is a procedure that needs to be done at the registration phase of the user, 
	through myslice, Broker etc. but I will answer you in a couple of days for sure. -->
	</p>

	<p>
		You will then need to prepare the resource by loading an OMF image on it:
	</p>
	
	<p class="command">
		$ omf load -i baseline_grid.ndz -t omf.nitos.node016
	</p>

	<p>
		Turn on the node:
	</p>
	
	<p class="command">
		$ omf tell -a on -t omf.nitos.node016
	</p>
	<p>
		And finally ssh on the node:
	</p>
	<p class="command">
		$ ssh root@node016
	</p>
	<p>
		On the node itself you will have to modify the file /etc/omf-resctl-5.3/omf-resctl.yaml according to your slice settings and then
		restart the OMF Resource Controller and finally execute the experiment:
	</p>
	<p class="command">
		$ omf exec --slice slice_name your_exp.rb
	</p>

	<p>
	Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for secure data communication, remote command-line login, remote command execution, and other secure network services between two networked computers that connects, via a secure channel over an insecure network, a server and a client (running SSH server and SSH client programs, respectively). The protocol specification distinguishes between two major versions that are referred to as SSH-1 and SSH-2.

	<p>NEPI, the Network Experimentation Programming Interface, is a life-cycle management tool for network experiments. The idea behind NEPI is to provide a single tool to design, deploy, and control network experiments, and gather the experiment results. Going further, NEPI was specially conceived to function with arbitrary experimentation platforms, so researchers could use a single tool to work with network simulators, emulators, or physical testbeds, or even a mixture of them. To accomplish this, NEPI provides a high-level interface to describe experiments that is independent from any experimentation platform, but is able to capture platform specific configurations. Experiment definitions can be stored in XML format to be later reproduced, and modified according to experimentation needs. Experiment execution is orchestrated by a global experiment controller, that is platform independent, and different platform-dependent testbed controllers, creating a control hierarchy that is able t adapt to platform specific requirements while providing an integrated control scheme.</p>

	<p>OMF is a Testbed Control, Measurement and Management Framework.</p>
	<p>
	OMF was originally developed for the ORBIT wireless testbed at Winlab, Rutgers University. Since 2007, OMF has been actively extended to operate on testbeds with many different type of network and resource technologies. It is now deployed and used on different testbeds in Australia, Europe, and in the U.S. OMF is currently being extended further to support exciting new features and technologies. This website is hosting this ongoing activity. OMF development is now conducted essentially within the TEMPO project at NICTA (Australia) in strong collaboration with Winlab (Rutgers University).
	</p>
	<p>In addition to the main OMF software, this site also hosts OMF sub-projects addressing various related aspects of a testbed's control, measurement, and management.</p>
